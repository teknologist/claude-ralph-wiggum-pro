## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.7] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Archive Orphaned Loop Button**: Fixed bug where archive button appeared to "do nothing"
  - Root cause: Archive endpoint wrote `outcome: 'orphaned'` which mapped back to status `'orphaned'`, so session remained in Active tab with archive button still visible
  - Fix: Changed archive outcome to `'archived'` - a new status type that moves sessions to Past tab
  - Added `'archived'` to Session status and outcome types in both backend and frontend
  - Added gray "Archived" status badge in StatusBadge component
- **Stop Hook `stop_hook_active` Check**: Removed overly aggressive exit when `stop_hook_active=true`
  - Root cause: Previous fix (v2.2.6) added check that prevented Ralph loops from continuing past first iteration
  - Ralph loops are intentional and have their own safeguards (max_iterations, completion promise)
  - The `stop_hook_active` flag is logged for debugging but no longer causes early exit
- **Active Loop Blocking**: Fixed issue where starting a new loop while one is active didn't properly block
  - Root cause: Setup script exited with error code 1, but bash block continued and final "work on task" instruction was always shown
  - Fix: Added exit code check in ralph-loop.md command to stop execution and show clear STOP message when setup fails

## [2.2.6] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Session ID Mismatch in Stop Hook**: Fixed critical bug where stop hook couldn't find state files due to session ID mismatch between hook input and environment
  - Root cause: Hook input `session_id` sometimes differs from `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var (e.g., after `/clear` or with multiple Claude Code processes)
  - Fix: Stop hook now tries `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var as fallback when hook input session_id doesn't match any state file
  - Added security validation for fallback session ID (same regex + path traversal checks)

### Added
- **`stop_hook_active` Check**: Added check per Claude Code docs to prevent infinite loops when stop hook triggers repeatedly
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed process tree walk logging in `setup-ralph-loop.sh` to diagnose session ID resolution
  - Logs each PID checked during process tree walk
  - Logs when falling back to env var vs using PPID file

### Changed
- **Checklist Service Debug Function**: Renamed `debug_log()` to `_checklist_debug_log()` in `checklist-service.sh` to avoid overwriting parent script's function when sourced

## [2.2.5] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **PPID Mismatch in Session ID Tracking**: Fixed critical bug where loops after `/clear` failed to iterate
  - Root cause: Hook's `$PPID` (Claude Code's PID) differs from script's `$PPID` (shell subprocess PID)
  - `setup-ralph-loop.sh` looked for wrong PPID file, fell back to stale env var
  - Fix: Walk up process tree until finding a PID with corresponding session file
  - Now correctly finds Claude Code's PID regardless of shell layer depth

## [2.2.4] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Session ID Mismatch After `/clear` (Complete Fix)**: Replaced ineffective `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` sourcing with PPID-based session tracking
  - Root cause: `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is only available to hooks, not to slash commands/scripts
  - Solution: Session-start-hook now writes session ID to `~/.claude/ralph-wiggum-pro/sessions/ppid_$PPID.id`
  - `setup-ralph-loop.sh` reads from PPID file (authoritative source), falls back to env var
  - `session-end-hook.sh` cleans up PPID file on session end
  - PPID identifies the Claude Code process, survives `/clear`, and is unique per terminal

### Security
- **PPID Validation**: Added numeric validation for `$PPID` in all files before using in file paths (prevents path traversal)
- **Atomic Session File Write**: Session ID file uses `mktemp` + `mv` pattern to prevent partial reads

## [2.2.3] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Session ID Race Condition After `/clear`**: Fixed remaining race condition where `setup-ralph-loop.sh` would read stale `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var after `/clear`
  - Root cause: Even though session-start-hook wrote fresh ID to `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`, the in-memory env var remained stale
  - Fix: `setup-ralph-loop.sh` now sources `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` before reading `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` to get the authoritative value

### Added
- **Debug Logging in setup-ralph-loop.sh**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track session ID handling
  - Logs `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` path, `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` before/after sourcing, and final `SESSION_ID`
  - Includes warning when `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is set but file doesn't exist
  - Uses same log rotation mechanism as other hooks (1MB limit)

## [2.2.2] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Session Log Rotation**: `sessions.jsonl` now auto-rotates at 100 entries to prevent unbounded growth
  - Transcript files for purged entries are automatically cleaned up
  - Rotation runs after each log write (both start and completion entries)

### Fixed
- **Slash Command Parse Error**: Fixed zsh parse error in `/test-session-id` command by splitting into multiple simple bash blocks instead of complex single-line command chains
- **Session ID Mismatch After `/clear`**: Fixed bug where Ralph loops would stop iterating after running `/clear` command
  - Root cause: `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var retained old session ID after `/clear` generated a new one
  - `session-end-hook.sh`: Now clears `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` from `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` on session end
  - `session-start-hook.sh`: Now replaces (instead of appends) `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` to prevent stale values
  - Added debug logging with auto-rotation to `session-start-hook.sh` for troubleshooting session ID issues
- **Consistent Atomic Temp File Operations**: Applied `mktemp` pattern across all hooks
  - `stop-hook.sh`, `session-start-hook.sh`, `session-end-hook.sh`: Debug log rotation now uses `mktemp`
  - `log-session.sh`: Session log rotation and JSON entry temp files use `mktemp`
  - Added trap handlers with proper double-quoting and `trap - EXIT` cleanup
  - Added `wc -c` fallback with proper error suppression for file size detection

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Command Path References**: Fixed `ralph-loop.md` command to look for state files in global `~/.claude/ralph-wiggum-pro/loops/` directory instead of project-local `.claude/` (fixes "no matches found" error)
- **Documentation Paths**: Updated path references in CLAUDE.md, README.md, help.md, ralph-stats.md, and ralph-dashboard/README.md to match v2.2.0 architecture
- **Checklist Service Paths**: Fixed `checklist-service.sh` to use new global directory paths
- **Test Suite Paths**: Updated all test files to use new global directory structure with proper HOME override

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **Global Directory Consolidation**: All Ralph data now stored under `~/.claude/ralph-wiggum-pro/` with subdirectories:
  - `loops/` - State files for active loops
  - `logs/` - Session logs (sessions.jsonl, debug.log)
  - `transcripts/` - Iteration and full transcript files
- **State File Naming**: State files now named `ralph-loop.{session_id}.local.md` using session_id directly (no file iteration)
- **Loop ID Format**: Changed from UUID to 5-character short ID for better readability and transcript file naming
- **Active Loop Detection**: File existence = active loop (removed `active` field from frontmatter)
- **Simplified Frontmatter**: Removed `active` field; presence of state file indicates active loop

### Added
- **SessionEnd Hook**: Automatic cleanup of state files when terminal closes (claude_session_end event)
- **Force Flag**: `--force` option for `/ralph-loop` to auto-cancel existing loops without prompting
- **cancel-ralph-loop.sh**: New standalone script for programmatic loop cancellation

### Removed
- **Backward Compatibility Code**: Removed fallback logic for old directory paths (`~/.claude/ralph-wiggum-pro-logs/`)
- **Project-scoped State Files**: State files no longer stored in project `.claude/` directory

### Security
- **Path Validation**: Updated loop-manager.ts to validate state file paths against global loops directory

## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Checklist System**: Complete task and criteria tracking for Ralph loops
  - Bash service (`checklist-service.sh`) for checklist CRUD operations
  - Dashboard API endpoint (`/api/checklist/:loopId`) for checklist management
  - Dashboard service (`checklist-service.ts`) for server-side checklist operations
  - React component (`ChecklistProgress`) for displaying checklist progress
  - React hook (`useChecklist`) for checklist data fetching and updates
  - Support for tasks and acceptance criteria with status tracking
- **Checklist Progress in Stats**: `ralph-stats` command now displays checklist progress in a new column (format: "X/Y tasks • A/B criteria")
- **Checklist in Iteration Messages**: Stop-hook now shows checklist summary in each iteration's system message

### Changed
- **Stats Table Layout**: Removed duration column from `ralph-stats` output to make room for checklist progress column
- **Task Column Width**: Reduced task display width from 30 to 22 characters in `ralph-stats` to accommodate new checklist column
- **Loop ID Validation**: Simplified validation in stop-hook from aggressive regex to basic sanity check (loop_id is internally generated, not user input)
- **E2E Test Organization**: Moved e2e tests from `ralph-dashboard/e2e/` to `ralph-dashboard/tests/e2e/` for better organization

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

  - Highlighted search terms across iterations
  - 422 comprehensive unit and E2E tests (96.96% coverage)
- **Error Boundaries**: React ErrorBoundary component for TranscriptTimeline and FullTranscriptModal to prevent dashboard crashes
- **Dashboard Components**:
  - TranscriptTimeline: Collapsible timeline with search, export, and "view full" actions
  - FullTranscriptModal: Modal for viewing complete transcript with search
  - ErrorBoundary: Class component for catching React rendering errors
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/transcript/iterations/:loopId` - Get paginated iterations
  - `/api/transcript/full/:loopId` - Get full transcript with user prompt
  - `/api/transcript/check/:loopId` - Check transcript availability
- **React Query Hooks**:
  - `useTranscriptIterations` - Fetch iteration data
  - `useFullTranscript` - Fetch complete transcript
  - `useTranscriptAvailability` - Check if transcript exists
- **Bash Hook Security**: Added `validate_loop_id()` function with regex validation, path traversal prevention, and max length limit
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright tests for transcript timeline, modal, search, and export functionality

### Fixed
- **Critical: Bash hook silent failures**: Removed `|| true` patterns, added proper error checking and logging to transcript operations in stop-hook.sh
- **Critical: Empty catch blocks**: Added error logging to all catch blocks in transcript-service.ts
- **Critical: Duplicate type definitions**: Removed duplicate types from transcript.ts API file, imported from central types.ts
- **High Priority: E2E test timeouts**: Replaced hard-coded `waitForTimeout()` with explicit wait conditions for better reliability
- **High Priority: Missing error boundaries**: Wrapped TranscriptTimeline and FullTranscriptModal with ErrorBoundary components
- **Unit test mock lifecycle**: Fixed hooks.test.tsx error tests to use `mockImplementation` with rejections instead of `mockResolvedValueOnce` to properly handle React Query retries
- **Unit test ambiguous selectors**: Fixed SessionDetail.test.tsx to use `getAllByText` for elements appearing multiple times

### Changed
- Dashboard now displays iteration count in transcript timeline header
- Improved error messages for transcript loading failures
- Better mobile responsiveness for transcript timeline and modal
- Enhanced loading states with spinners for transcript data

## [2.0.19] - 2026-01-05

### Removed
- **Near-miss detection**: Removed misleading "ALMOST! You forgot the `<promise>` tags!" message from stop-hook - XML tags were being detected correctly but not displayed, making this warning inaccurate

## [2.0.18] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Stop-hook debug logging**: Comprehensive debug logging to `~/.claude/ralph-wiggum-pro-logs/debug.log` for diagnosing loop issues - logs session IDs, state file lookups, promise detection, and blocking decisions
- **Dashboard archive API**: New `/api/sessions/archive` endpoint for managing archived sessions
- **Dashboard archive hook**: `useArchiveLoop` React Query hook for archive operations

### Changed
- **Log session error handling**: `log_session()` function now logs errors to debug.log instead of silently suppressing them with `2>/dev/null || true`
- **Dashboard tests**: Added comprehensive test coverage for SessionCard, SessionDetail, SessionRow, StatusBadge, and API hooks

## [2.0.17] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed
- **Dashboard test mock lifecycle**: Fixed potential flaky tests in SessionTable by adding proper `beforeEach`/`afterEach` hooks for mock cleanup, ensuring mobile view mode mock is reset even if test fails
- **E2E test route interception**: Narrowed route patterns to specific endpoints (`**/api/sessions/*/cancel` and `**/api/sessions/*` with method checks) to prevent interference with parallel tests
- **Script error handling**: Added comprehensive error handling to `calc-coverage.mjs` script with helpful messages for file not found, invalid JSON, and other I/O errors
- **Bash script documentation**: Added clarifying comments in `stop-hook.sh` to explain `|| echo ""` and `|| true` patterns used for handling grep exit codes under `set -e`

### Changed
- **Dashboard test organization**: Refactored mobile behavior tests into nested describe block with proper lifecycle hooks
- **Documentation**: Updated test count badge in dashboard README to reflect 274 passing tests
- **Test references**: Added cross-references from unit tests to E2E tests that cover error handlers with alert() calls

## [2.0.16] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed
- **Stop-hook exit code 1 failures**: Added error handling to prevent `grep` commands from causing script termination under `set -euo pipefail` when they find no matching lines. Affects grep operations in `find_state_file_from_log`, field extraction (iteration, max_iterations, completion_promise), and started_at parsing.

## [2.0.15] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed
- **Critical: Empty lines in sessions.jsonl breaking stop-hook**: log-session.sh was writing blank lines between JSONL entries, causing jq error "Cannot index array with string 'session_id'" when stop-hook tried to query the log file
- **Stop-hook jq query**: Now filters empty lines before processing with grep to prevent jq errors on malformed JSONL data

### Changed
- **Dashboard tests**: Added 4 new tests (log-parser retry handling, loop-manager invalid path errors, StatsBar undefined duration, mobile viewport E2E)

## [2.0.14] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed
- **State file path resolution**: Stop-hook now queries session log for absolute state file path, fixing bug where completion wasn't logged when exiting from subdirectory (e.g., `ralph-dashboard/`)
- **Security**: Added path validation for state_file_path from log to prevent path traversal attacks
- **Security**: Temp file creation now uses `mktemp` for atomic file operations instead of PID-based naming

### Changed
- **Dashboard tests**: Refactored DOM queries to use Testing Library `within()` helper with proper null guards instead of non-null assertions
- **Dashboard tests**: Added 15 new tests for SessionCard covering expand/collapse, modal interactions, time calculations, and edge cases (now 36 tests total, 91.46% function coverage)
- **Dashboard**: Added `@testing-library/user-event` dependency for improved user interaction testing

## [2.0.13] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Documentation**: Updated README and help command to clarify that prompts must include `<promise>KEYWORD</promise>` instructions
- **Documentation**: Removed misleading "go back to step" language - Ralph naturally iterates without explicit loop instructions
- **Documentation**: Single-word `--completion-promise` values no longer shown with unnecessary quotes

## [2.0.12] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Duration calculation timezone bug**: `log-session.sh` now uses `-u` flag when parsing UTC timestamps, fixing incorrect durations (e.g., showing 1h 4m instead of 5m)
- **Dashboard modal padding**: Removed inconsistent `pb-safe` from ConfirmModal for consistent 24px padding on all sides

## [2.0.11] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Critical: Completion promise detection broken** - Stop hook used incorrect jq path `.role` instead of `.message.role` to find assistant messages in transcript, causing `<promise>` tags to never be detected and loops to run forever
- Updated test fixtures to use correct Claude Code transcript format `{"message":{"role":"assistant",...}}` instead of incorrect `{"role":"assistant","message":{...}}`

## [2.0.10] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Mobile responsive dashboard design**: Swipe left to delete, swipe right to cancel loops
- Dashboard progress bar visualization for loop iterations

### Fixed
- State file lookup in stop-hook now scans frontmatter for `session_id` match instead of relying on environment variable
- Fallback to most recent state file by `started_at` timestamp when multiple exist

## [2.0.8] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **State file lookup in ralph-loop.md**: Fixed incorrect path pattern that used `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` instead of scanning frontmatter for `session_id` match (consistent with stop-hook.sh)
- Added fallback to pick most recent state file by `started_at` timestamp if multiple exist (edge case from failed cleanup)

## [2.0.7] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Progress Bar Visualization**: Visual progress bar for loop iterations in dashboard
  - Color-coded: green (<50%), coral (50-69%), orange (70-89%), red (>=90%)
  - Pulse animation for active sessions
  - Two sizes: 'sm' for table rows, 'md' for detail view
  - Shows percentage and iteration count labels
  - 22 comprehensive tests for ProgressBar component
- Loop ID and Session ID display fields in SessionDetail component with truncate tooltips
- Atomic `--delete` flag for `log-session.sh` to delete state files immediately after logging
- Test for backward-compatible sessions (legacy `loop_id` fallback)

### Fixed
- **Dashboard bug**: Frontend used `session_id` instead of `loop_id` for cancel/delete API calls, causing "Loop not found" errors
- Renamed `sessionId` to `loopId` in server code for naming consistency

### Changed
- Error messages updated from "Session not found" to "Loop not found"
- Renamed `validateSessionId` to `validateLoopId` in server validation

## [2.0.6] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Unique Loop Identifiers (`loop_id`)**: Each `/ralph-loop` invocation now generates a unique UUID, fixing dashboard issues when loops are cancelled and restarted in the same session
- Backward compatibility for legacy log entries without `loop_id` (falls back to `session_id`)

### Changed
- State files now named with `loop_id` instead of `session_id` (`.claude/ralph-loop.{loop_id}.local.md`)
- Stop hook finds state files by scanning frontmatter for `session_id` match (cross-platform compatible)
- Dashboard groups sessions by `loop_id` instead of `session_id`

### Fixed
- Dashboard now correctly shows restarted loops as separate entries instead of incorrectly merging them
- Fixed macOS sed compatibility in stop-hook.sh (BSD/GNU compatible pattern matching)
- Fixed `log-session.sh` to handle older state files without `loop_id` field

## [2.0.5] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- Near-miss detection for completion promise: when Claude outputs the phrase without `<promise>` XML tags, the hook now shows a clear correction message instead of silently continuing
- Enhanced system message format with multi-line display and visual separators for better visibility

### Fixed
- Fixed timezone bug in `test-list-ralph-loops.sh` test 8 causing CI failures on Linux (epoch-based time calculation)

## [2.0.4] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- Renamed plugin from `ralph-wiggum` to `ralph-wiggum-pro`
